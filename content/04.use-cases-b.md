## GitHub in EcoEvo examples (Part 2)

### Project management
*Contributors to this section:* Kaitlyn Gaynor

GitHub can be a powerful tool for team-based project management, allowing collaborators to share feedback, brainstorm ideas, and troubleshoot problems. The "Issues" feature of GitHub allows for discrete tasks and sub-tasks to be identified, assigned to team members, and categorized with custom labels, and the new "Discussion" feature serves as a message board for conversation. Scripts and commit messages can be linked directly to issues and discussions, providing a clear record of project workflow. The use of GitHub for all project-related conversation and planning, rather than e-mail or messaging tools, makes it easier to keep track of progress throughout the lifespan of a project and less likely for issues to slip through the cracks. It is not essential for all team members to have proficiency in git or programming, as users can interact with Issues and Discussions via web browser or e-mail. 

Can talk about ESS-DIVE's project management using ZenHub/Jira

### Building website

Seems like the technical aspect of this is discussed in Dawson, Chris (2016). Building Tools with GitHub: Customize Your Workflow. O'Reilly Media
GitHub pages allows any .html document to be rendered as a website with a URL. 
This could be, for example, a report written in markdown or R Markdown rendered into a .html file.

### Making code citable
*Contributors to this section:*
Linking with Zenodo, etc. to achieve a DOI helps work become findable, gives proper attribution (Hampton et al. 2015)
It is important to remember that GitHub is NOT a long-term data/code repository by itself (accounts can be deleted at will), so adding GitHub links in papers (which I've seen plenty of times), is not a good practice (imo). Instead, including a DOI (like above bullet) is better.

### Collaborative (code) editing
*Contributors to this section:* Kaitlyn Gaynor

From its inception, one of the primary uses of GitHub has been for collaborative coding.

Is it worth walking through how collaborative code editing works through GitHub, or just pointing to all the available resources for this? (e.g. https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)

GitHub can facilitate interactions between research advisors and advisees, providing a platform for students or other trainees to share in-progress code, and flag specific challenges or questions for their supervisors or mentors. Periodic code review can also help advisors to identify errors early in the process, and inform further training and mentorship to fill gaps in skills. 

### Writing manuscript
*contributors to this section:*
Caveat that GitHub has been called out for not being so user-friendly for manuscript development (Ram 2013). But getting better?
Tools that link with GitHub have been developed with synchronous writing in mind. HackMD provides a collaborative writing platform based on Markdown that integrates with GitHub.  
We used this platform early on in the process of writing this manuscript to generate an outline.
