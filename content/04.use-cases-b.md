## GitHub in EcoEvo examples (Part 2)

### Project management
*Contributors to this section:*
issue & discussion features - can assign tasks, seek feedback, bounce ideas around, troubleshoot problems.
Can talk about ESS-DIVE's project management using ZenHub/Jira

### Building website
*Contributors to this section:*
Seems like the technical aspect of this is discussed in Dawson, Chris (2016). Building Tools with GitHub: Customize Your Workflow. O'Reilly Media
GitHub pages allows any .html document to be rendered as a website with a URL. 
This could be, for example, a report written in markdown or R Markdown rendered into a .html file.

### Making code citable
*Contributors to this section:*
Linking with Zenodo, etc. to achieve a DOI helps work become findable, gives proper attribution (Hampton et al. 2015)
It is important to remember that GitHub is NOT a long-term data/code repository by itself (accounts can be deleted at will), so adding GitHub links in papers (which I've seen plenty of times), is not a good practice (imo). Instead, including a DOI (like above bullet) is better.

### Collaborative (code) editing
*Contributors to this section:*
Is it worth walking through how collaborative code editing works through GitHub, or just pointing to all the available resources for this? (e.g. https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)

### Writing manuscript
*contributors to this section:*
Caveat that GitHub has been called out for not being so user-friendly for manuscript development (Ram 2013). But getting better?
Tools that link with GitHub have been developed with synchronous writing in mind. HackMD provides a collaborative writing platform based on Markdown that integrates with GitHub.  
We used this platform early on in the process of writing this manuscript to generate an outline.
