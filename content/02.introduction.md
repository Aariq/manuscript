## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### High-level/general background about GitHub
*Contributors to this section: RCO, SSHS .*  

With over 73 million registered users, GitHub and its underlying version control system Git, are the _de facto_ platform for collaboration on computer code [@https://github.com/about]. 
GitHub has become an indispensable tool for software developers because, through version control, users can track changes to multiple files and folders over time [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928]. 
Thus, users have an "audit trail" on the files they choose to store on their GitHub repositories which simultaneously less _ad hoc_ than passing files back and forth yet able to scale up as projects take on more files or collaborators [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
GitHub as useful tool and code repository service can broadly facilitate openly available source code alongside concomitant collaborative development. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947]

Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) are starting to collaborate on software as part of their research, and some are interacting with GitHub for the first time [@doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0160]. 
For first-time users, the GitHub learning curve can seem overwhelming because the creation of the platform and its features were initially centred in collaboration for software development [CITE].
However, by leveraging existing tools on GitHub and the wide range of collaborations they can enable, researchers in EEB can make the most out of their research and collaborative projects.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the version control system that enables all the collaborative tools available on GitHub.
In Git, changes performed to files are registered as uniquely identified "commits", which are a snapshot of the line-by-line changes that have been voluntarily performed at that moment.
Because the details of interacting with Git can get very technical very quick, we focus instead on the web platform GitHub.
However, we suggest those interested in Git explore the many papers [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668] [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947] and books [@https://happygitwithr.com/] that can provide an introduction to git.
Despite the prevelance of technical papers and books that focus on Git or GitHub for the software development community, there are much fewer resources for EEB researchers who want to begin collaborating through GitHub.
We acknowledge that GitHub is not the only way for productive collaboration on cloud-based research documents and code, so we encourage researchers in EEB to take the elements of a GitHub that fit into their workflow.
Because GitHub as web platform is so well documented and has a robust user community, scientists can take advantage of many collaborative aspects without knowing even a line of Git code.

### What's already been done with GitHub in EcoEvo

Very friendly description of what GitHub is and the main uses and advantages of using it in the natural sciences back in 2016 (Perkel 2016).
What's missing about GitHub in EcoEvo and our objective: Introducing the GitHub ecosystem that's composed of many different elements!

### What's missing about GitHub in EcoEvo and our objective
*Contributors to this section:*  

Simple habits (of which github is one component) can do a lot to make research more reproducible and collaborative (Alston and Rick 2021).
In EcoEvo Github use is predicated on an understanding in R. 
This close connection has some benefits, but other programming languages are frequently used by researchers (e.g. Python, Julia). 
Lots of ways to use GitHub that are independent from R. 
We have in this hackathon a definite focus on R tools for interacting with GitHub, but sometimes the issues we present at 'Github' issues might be more about the ways that we interact with Github (i.e. through R vs. bash shell)

I am just testing what happens if I add a sentence. (Saeed) :) 
It is also important to consider what are the aims of researchers and how they want contribute in...

-   **repository**:

-   **commit**: Commits are like snapshots in the development of a project.
    Commits can include changes in multiple files and must include a brief commit message describing the changes made.
    A typical workflow is to make some related changes in files, make a commit (e.g. "generate and include fig1 in results"), and after several commits to **push** those commits to the remote GitHub **repository**.

-   clone: Cloning a **repository** is a way of making a local copy (i.e. on your computer) of a GitHub **repository**.
    If you have access to **push** to a **repository**, this can be a first step to contributing to a project.

-   branch: Development branches can be created at any point in time and work on each branch can continue independently.
    This is useful for testing out new ideas (both code and text) which may or may not eventually get integrated into the main branch of the project.
    Branches can also be used to isolate contributions of multiple contributors.
    Each person working on their own branch eliminates problems that arise when conflicting edits are pushed to the same branch.
    Changes in a development branch can be merged into the main branch via **pull requests**.
    Branches can only be made by those who are given access to the project **repository**.

-   fork: A fork is a copy of a **repository** hosted on GitHub.
    If a repository is public, then anyone can make a fork.
    Even if they do not have access to push to the original repository, they can make a fork and edit it independently.
    Forks are linked to the original GitHub repository and "upstream" changes (those in the original repository) can be merged to keep the fork up to date with the original project.
    Changes made in the fork can be integrated into the original project via **pull requests**.

-   push/pull: When **commits** are made in a project locally, they must be synced with the remote GitHub repository by "**pushing**" them.
    Changes on a GitHub repository can then be "**pulled**" to keep your local version of the project up to date.

-   pull request: A pull request is a request that the owner of a GitHub repository integrate changes you've made on either a **branch** in the repository or in your own **fork**.
    When you initiate a pull request, you must provide a description of what changes are made.
    Some automated tests may be run and review may be required before integrating your changes.

-  merge:

-  status: Checking the status of the  projects

-  init: Initializing a new git database

-  log: Check the history of the project
