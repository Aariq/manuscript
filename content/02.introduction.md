Most scientists, including ecologists and evolutionary biologists, have become critically dependent on computational tools in their research [see @doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
Researchers now write and use code as part of their research workflow to perform a wide-variety of tasks facilitating scientific elaboration, ranging from data management, data analysis, study replication, to the application and the development of tools for hypothesis testing.
This strong code-dependent workflow imposes steep requirements towards an efficient, well-documented process in the publication and collaboration of maintenaible scientific code [@doi:10.1038/d41586-020-02462-7].
To facilitate this process, scientists have been increasingly borrowing and adopting tools from  information system technology, such as cloud-based services for documentation and version control [_e.g._ from the Google Suite (with Docs, Sheets and Drive), the Microsoft Suite (with Word, Excel and OneDrive), and Github] [@doi: 10.1038/538127a].
However, most researchers lack exposure to adequate software development practices and are required to dedicate valuable time and effort to self-teach the use of research-faciliting tools, and thus may find challenges when applying adequate standards in the maintenance of their scientific code [@doi:10.1145/2063348.2063374; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745; @doi:10.1109/SECSE.2009.5069155].
Here, we provide researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology with critical review and discussion on practical workflows in one of the most used web-based platforms for version control and collaboration: Github.

With over 73 million registered users, GitHub and Git, its underlying version control system, are a widely used platform for documentation and collaboration on computer code [@https://github.com/about].
GitHub has become an indispensable tool for software developers because, through version control, users have a detailed, chronological record on the files and directories stored in their repositories [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928].
This workflow provides a strong and clear advantage over receiving, processing and sending files back-and-forth, a workflow that can easily become challenging and time-consuming in projects extending in time and in the number of collaborators [@doi:10.1186/1751-0473-8-7].
GitHub can broadly facilitate openly available source code alongside concomitant collaborative development. [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947]

Researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) have been interacting with GitHub [@doi:10.1038/s41559-017-0160; @doi:10.1038/538127a].
are starting to collaborate on software as part of their research, and some are 
The GitHub learning curve can be overwhelming for first-time users, as its creation and its features were initially centered on collaboration for software development [@doi:10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752419].
However, by leveraging existing tools on GitHub and the wide range of collaborations they can enable, researchers in EEB can make the most out of their collaborative projects.

### What's already been written about GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the version control system that enables all the collaborative tools available on GitHub.
In Git, changes performed to files are registered as uniquely identified "commits", which are a snapshot of the line-by-line changes that have been made at that moment.
Because the details of interacting with Git can get very technical very quick, we focus instead on the web platform GitHub.
However, we suggest those interested in Git explore the many papers [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947] and books [@https://happygitwithr.com/] that can provide an introduction to git.
Because GitHub as web platform is so well documented and has a robust user community, scientists can take advantage of many collaborative aspects without knowing even a line of Git code.
Despite the prevalence of technical papers and books that focus on Git or GitHub for the software development community, there are fewer resources for EEB researchers who want to begin collaborating through GitHub.
We acknowledge that GitHub is not the only way for productive collaboration on cloud-based research documents and code, so we encourage researchers in EEB to take the elements of working with GitHub that fit into their workflow.

### What's missing about GitHub in EcoEvo and our objective

*Contributors to this section: RCO*

Our manuscript is the result of a hackathon held during the 2021 conference for the [Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (SORTEE)](https://www.sortee.org/).
We convened a group of ~30 EEB researchers with varying levels of familiarity with using GitHub as part of their research.
During the hackathon, we identified a need for a more friendly introduction to that ways EEB researchers can start using GitHub to make their research more collaborative and transparent.
While there have been numerous calls for more researchers in the natural sciences to leverage GitHub's features [@doi:10.1038/538127a], few resources provide tractable examples and practical guidance for first-time GitHub users.
Simple data and code manage habits (of which GitHub is one increasingly important component) make research more reproducible and collaborative (Alston and Rick 2021).
Most importantly, leveraging GitHub for collaborating on a variety of research tasks, with others who do the same, can ultimately enable EEB researchers to spend less time on creating novel processes for collaboration and more time on their scientific research [@doi:10.3897/rio.6.e56508].

### Box 1: Definitions

<!-- Contributors to this section: ERS, Ali -->

<!--# I thought it might be helpful to have a box with short definitions of git/GitHub terminology used in the manuscript. If any of these are discussed more in depth in the main text, they may not need to be here. -->

-   **repository**: A collection of files (e.g. a directory) tracked by git. Commonly shortened to "repo"

-   **commit**: Commits are like snapshots in the development of a project.
    Commits can include changes in multiple files and must include a brief commit message describing the changes made.
    A typical workflow is to make some related changes in files, make a commit (e.g. "generate and include fig1 in results"), and after several commits to **push** those commits to the remote GitHub **repository**.

-   **clone**: Cloning a **repository** is a way of making a local copy (i.e. on your computer) of a GitHub **repository**.
    If you have access to **push** to a **repository**, this can be a first step to contributing to a project.

-   **branch**: Development branches can be created at any point in time and work on each branch can continue independently.
    This is useful for testing out new ideas (both code and text) which may or may not eventually get integrated into the main branch of the project.
    Branches can also be used to isolate contributions of multiple contributors.
    Each person working on their own branch eliminates problems that arise when conflicting edits are pushed to the same branch.
    Changes in a development branch can be **merged** into the main branch via **pull requests**.
    Branches can only be made by those who are given access to the project **repository**.

-   **fork**: A fork is a copy of a **repository** hosted on GitHub.
    If a repository is public, then anyone can make a fork.
    Even if they do not have access to push to the original repository, they can make a fork and edit it independently.
    Forks are linked to the original GitHub repository and "upstream" changes (those in the original repository) can be **merged** to keep the fork up to date with the original project.
    Changes made in the fork can be integrated into the original project via **pull requests**.

-   **push/pull**: When **commits** are made in a project locally, they must be synced with the remote GitHub repository by "**pushing**" them.
    Changes on a GitHub repository can then be "**pulled**" to keep your local version of the project up to date.

-   **pull request**: A pull request is a request that the owner of a GitHub repository integrate changes you've made on either a **branch** in the repository or in your own **fork**.
    When you initiate a pull request, you must provide a description of what changes are made.
    Some automated tests may be run and review may be required before integrating your changes.

-   **merge**: Combining **commits** from two different branches together into one **branch**



<!-- ERS: while having a definition for all common git commands might be helpful to some, I think this box should probably only include jargon that gets used in the manuscript. So I think we should remove any definitions not used in the manuscript before submission
Ali: I agree with ERS and delete my additions except "merge" -->
