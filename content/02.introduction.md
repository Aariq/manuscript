## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### High-level/general background about GitHub
*contributors to this section: RCO,*  

The software development community has used the web platform GitHub, and its underlying version control system Git to collaboratively work on code. Now has over 73 million registered users (GitHub, 2020). 
As ecologists and evolutionary biologists start to use and collaborate on computer code as part of their research many are interacting with GitHub for the first time.
We are focusing on how researchers in EEB can leverage existing tools to make the most out of their research and collaboartive projects. 
Acknowledge that some of the GitHub features are made with software development in mind, and that one of the goals of this paper is to 'translate' the features into uses for EEB

### What's already been written about GitHub
*contributors to this section:* 
Thereâ€™s lots of detailed info in other papers about version control. Much less about using it as a tool for **collaboration**!
We'll avoid going into the underlying version control language (called git) since that discussion can get very technical very quick, and there are already many papers (Blischak et al. 2016; Perez-Riverol, 2016), books (Bryan 2018), tutorials go into that. More importantly, the GitHub platform is so robust at this point, that you can take advantage of many collaborative aspects without knowing even a line of Git code.

### What's already been done with GitHub in EcoEvo
*contributors to this section:* 
Very friendly description of what GitHub is and the main uses and advantages of using it in the natural sciences back in 2016 (Perkel 2016)
What's missing about GitHub in EcoEvo and our objective: Introducing the GitHub ecosystem that's composed of many different elements!

### What's missing about GitHub in EcoEvo and our objective
*contributors to this section:* 
Simple habits (of which github is one component) can do a lot to make research more reproducible and collaborative (Alston and Rick 2021).
In EcoEvo Github use is predicated on an understanding in R. 
This close connection has some benefits, but other programming languages are frequently used by researchers (e.g. Python, Julia). 
Lots of ways to use GitHub that are independent from R. 
We have in this hackathon a definite focus on R tools for interacting with GitHub, but sometimes the issues we present at 'Github' issues might be more about the ways that we interact with Github (i.e. through R vs. bash shell)
