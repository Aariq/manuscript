### Storing and archiving version-controlled data
*contributors to this section:* 
Another potential use case/user perspective: Some people are just using GitHub to  backup their data, use their code on differnt machines. Just push and pull (Box 1) from their own repo. 
GitHub integrates with Zenodo, a popular, free data archiving service funded by CERN. After linking your GitHub account to Zenodo and turning on archiving, any time a release (Box 1) is made, a snapshot of the entire repository is archived in Zenodo with a versioned, citable DOI
