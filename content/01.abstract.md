## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Github is an online, cloud-based service that allows users to track, organize, discuss, share and collaborate on software and code.
In the past decade, the platform attracted more than 75 million users employing it to openly collaborate during code development.
Although research in ecology and evolution has become increasingly collaborative and computationally intensive, Github remains underused within these fields.
To help scientists adopt useful features from Github in their own workflows, we review thirteen practical ways to use the platform.
We outline features ranging from low to high technical difficulty: storing code, managing projects, coding collaboratively, conducting peer review, and writing a manuscript.
Because not all GitHub features are essentially useful for every researcher, we allocate existing development and collaborative workflows within Github - such as, tracking tasks, discussing edits to a manuscript, and submitting code to a repository - to the most common research development roles in ecology and evolution (project manager, coauthor, code contributor).
As more ecologists and evolutionary biologists migrate their workflows to GitHub, the broader scientific community stands to benefit from disciplines that push the boundaries of collaborative, transparent, and open research.
