### Project continuity

'thus preserving the long-term integrity of the project even as collaborations form and shift.â€™ (Hampton et al. 2015) 
better to have old versions on GitHub than on somebody's personal hard drive!

### GitHub organizations
*Contributors to this section:*
Lab organization as a place to house research compendia as well as codes of conduct, protocols, training documents, etc. (documents that evolve over time and are shaped collaboratively)
Students can have full ownership over repositories in organization, but stay with the lab after they've left.

### Misc other uses
*Contributors to this section: RCO*
There are many more potential uses of GitHub for EEB researchers, and we briefly highlight several of them here. First, community-driven data standards include instructions and templates that can help researchers format their data and metadata more consistently [@doi:10.1038/s41587-019-0080-8]. Often, these documents and templates are hosted on static websites as PDFs. However, GitHub is now seen as a useful site for storing the data standard documents since they can be version controlled, and commented on by the user community [e.g., ESS-DIVE's GitHub Community Space](https://github.com/ess-dive-community) [@doi:10.1029/2021EA001797]. 

Second ... 

Code review rOpenSci's code review process, and also caught mistakes in code of published papers that could have been caught in peer code review.  Also maybe say something about ReproHack.
