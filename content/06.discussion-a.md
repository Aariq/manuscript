## Discussion

### General pargrah on what GitHub can enable in EcoEvo
General paragraph on GitHub on how, given all the potential uses of GitHub, it can enable more collaborative EcoEvo research
Despite all the awesomeness of GitHub, there are still plenty of times when you might look to other plantforms for collaboration

### Why aren't more people using GitHub?
Learning to use Github requires time, but the payoff is *[may be?]* worth it.
Time vs. effort examples or analyses to demonstrate the payoff can help drive the point home to convince people to learn these tools

### Limitations

Our own limitations since we are mostly writing from the EcoEvo perspective/ additional github limitation
Reliance on R since we are generally in EcoEvo
Discussion of free vs. paid plans. When projects get highly collaborative may have to add / pay for accounts. At this point, little difference between paid and free.

File size limitations make it hard to sync entire folders with the cloud, especially if your repo is private. 
One trick to increase the size limit associated with a repository is to attach additional large files to the release once the repository is finalized and ready for re-use.

While we have written this manuscript collaboratively via GitHub and GitHub Actions, there was a substantial learning curve, and we are all early career researchers who are highly motivated to learn these skills.
This approach is likely less practical when collaborating with people at later career stages and a greater range of computational skills.
Real-time collaboration via GitHub is also not possible without relying on additional tools such as hackmd, so there is a longer delay to receive feedback from other collaborators, and a greater likelihood of conflicts.

Lack of GitHub help documents for non-English researchers in ecology and evolution leads them to miss the opportunity to fully understand the importance version control as well as the other benefits of GitHub.

### Using GitHub is a good start, but lots of practices to make repo more user friendly

Tips:

1- Check for the solution to your problem on the Github Help [webpage](https://docs.github.com/en).
This site contains very extensive and detailed documents with helpful screenshots. 
It is a good start point for handling a issue, but also has troubleshooting tips for specific problems.
Or Consider Tweeting your issue. 
There is a large community of GitHub users around the world who have likely faced analogous problems and may be able to provide quick solutions.
Try to follow blogs e.g.(https://github.blog/), twitter accounts or YouTube channels that regularly post practical solutions about common Github issues.

2- Consider taking free courses from [Software Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and sharing these courses with your lab members of colleagues.

3- Take the advantage of Github as an asynchronous working tools for team works. e.g. See the repository for [this paper](https://github.com/SORTEE-Github-Hackathon/manuscript/) as an example of a collaborative writing manuscript that includes discussions, issues, and a website via GitHub.

4- The GitHub [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) allows you to learn GitHub basics through short projects and tasks, and allows you to get feedback from their Learning Lab bot.

5- Check out the following [markdown cheatsheet](http://markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) so that you can write clear metadata README files for your repositories.

6- The Jenny Bryan universe of GitHub material provides a thorough and accessible introduction for a multitude of research-related uses for GitHub, and includes a [book](http://happygitwithr.com), [statistics course](http://stat545.com/) and [@doi:10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928].

7- Don't be afraid of trial and error. 
One of the best ways to learn Github is the trial and error method. 
Learning from your own mistakes can be the better way to master your abilities.
In any case, Github has the advantage of making it easy to go back to any steps that you desire via version controlling if you make mistakes. 

8- If you are an educator, include lectures on reproducibility and tools for creating reproducible workflows in your curricula. 
Some gradute programs now include coursework on course Rmarkdown and GitHub.
Getting students started with these tools earlier will prevent the resistance that comes from working with a less reproducible workflow for a longer period of time.

9- Try to begin commiting with GUI (Graphical user interface) tools e.g. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [git-gui](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) tools instead CLI (Command line interface) tools such as Terminal or Console.

10- Notifications of several Github active projects can be usually quite puzzling. 
Try to use tools like [Octobox](https://octobox.io/) for disentangling and managing multiple notifications from distinct GitHub projects.
