## Discussion

### General pargrah on what GitHub can enable in EcoEvo
General paragraph on GitHub on how, given all the potential uses of GitHub, it can enable more collaborative EcoEvo research
Despite all the awesomeness of GitHub, there are still plenty of times when you might look to other plantforms for collaboration

### Why aren't more people using GitHub?
Learning to use Github requires time, but the payoff is *[may be?]* worth it.
Time vs. effort examples or analyses to demonstrate the payoff can help drive the point home to convince people to learn these tools

### Limitations
Our own limitations since we are mostly writing from the EcoEvo perspective/ additional github limitation
Reliance on R since we are generally in EcoEvo
Discussion of free vs. paid plans. When projects get highly collaborative may have to add / pay for accounts. At this point, little difference between paid and free.

### Using GitHub is a good start, but lots of practices to make repo more user friendly

end off with our 5/10 tips for how to gain knowledge/practice with GitHub here


Note: "Current tips copied from the "Figure_brainstorming_v2, 6th slide" from the Google Drive"
can be extended as much as we can. Later we decide the most important ones related the manuscript. All suggestions are welcome.

Tips:

1- Github Help [webpage](https://docs.github.com/en): Very extensive and detailed documents. Useful for general or spesific problems and solutions. 

2- Dylan: We had an entire course in graduate school focused on reproducibility. The course introduced Rmarkdown and GitHub for most of the students -- we could possibly suggest departments incorporate these tools into coursework so that the incentives/motivation is there for studentsâ€¦ not sure if this comment fits here..
   Emma: I like this!

3- ?? Emma: Maybe a link to carpentries and other online resources? [Software Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

4- ??  Emma: Maybe a link to our repo for this paper ?

5- ??? Emma: Perhaps a link out to some sort of tutorial on the basic commands?

6- Emma: A tutorial on markdown so that people can write the readme?

7- The Jenny Bryan universe of GitHub material: [book](http://happygitwithr.com), [statistics course](http://stat545.com/) and her paper (from 2017?)

8- Don't afraid to trail and error: One of the best way to learn Github is the trail and error method. Learning from the mistakes is persistent in mind. Github has advantage to roll back to any steps that you desire via version controlling. You can check each steps for learning later.

9- [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/): With GitHub Learning Lab, grow your skills by completing fun, realistic projects. Get advice and helpful feedback from our friendly Learning Lab bot. Note: copied and pasted from the web page!!!.

10- Blogs, twitter etc.
